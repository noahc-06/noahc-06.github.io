                            <p>I arrived at RedHat at 10am and I was greeted by friendly faces.
                                 Our group of 8 was led into the Board room where we were given an introduction to RedHat. 
                                 We were told about RedHat's founders, how the company works and how they make their profits. We were also introduced to our Mentors,
                                who would help us throughout the week. I was paired up with Darragh, with our mentor being Dominik. </p>
                                
                            <h3 class="has-text-centered">Midday</h3>
                            <p> At 11:30am, Maggie gave us a quick tour of the office. We were also given our keycards(which only lasted the week)
                                and laptops we would be working on throughout the week. We then headed back to the boardroom where Jess showed us how to install and use 
                                an application called "Inkscape". We were set the task to design a logo for the games room, which we drew a rough sketch of on paper first. 
                                We then moved over to Inkscape, where we designed our Logos digitally.

                                <h3 class="has-text-centered">Afternoon</h3>
                            <p> Since it was now 1pm, we went for lunch for an hour. After lunch, we had a Git Workshop with Fiona and Tomas. We 
                                were showed how to setup up our github accounts and how to push our work from our local terminal to the github account.

                                I arrived at 9:30am on Tuesday. We headed into the boardroom first thing and finished up our github work and began
                                working on our blogs on our websites.Once 10:30am rolled around, Owen told gave us a presentation on Agile, which is a type of mindset 
                                used in group projects. He also showed us Trello, a service that helps users utilise the Agile mindset in their work.

                            <p>
                            At noon, David presented a Slideshow on his career and journey so far through college and Redhat. I found it very interesting and fascinating that
                            although nearly everyone had a different background, they still managed to end up in similar positions.

                            <p>
                                After lunch, Dominik held a workshop on Microbits, a little device that you could program to do certain things, like display numbers and simple pictures on a LED grid,
                                play sounds and even input physically with the A and B buttons on either side of the Microbit. I enjoyed this alot and 
                                Dominik made it very interesting with the challenges and tasks he set out.

                                I arrived at 9:30am on Wednesday. I arrived at 9:30am on Wednesday. I started the day by
                                 continuing to work writing up about my previous day's tasks in my blog. at 10:30, we headed into the boardroom where Christian and Dominik both gave us a presentation
                                 about their journeys and lifes at Redhat being an intern. I found Christian's drive to make it in the software space very motivating. When 11am rolled around, we were given an online presentation
                                 from Kellie on Human Computer Interaction. I found the techniques she showcased interesting.

                            <p>
                            At 12:30, Rachel gave an interesting presentation on a day in the life of a software Engineer and how she became one. 
                            She said she wasn't the greatest at maths throughout school which was reassuring. We then went for lunch after it was finished.

                                After lunch, we headed back into the boardroom where we were splitup into 3 teams. Each team was given the task of
                                designing and construtcing a bridge with just lollipop sticks,pipe cleaners and sellotape. The bridge had to be able to span a gap of 30cm
                                and hold as many tins of beans as possible. The other teams attempted to use triangles and other shapes to make their bridge
                                structurally sound, but our group made a giant slab from the sticks and covered it in an entire roll of sellotape. To no ones surprise, a massive slab of wood
                                and tape managed to hold 8 tins of beans, so our group won.

                              I arrived at 9:30 and headed straight to the board room, where a Waterford Office Town Hall meeting was held for about 30 minutes.
                              A hot breakfast buffet was served after in the canteen, which was delicious. We then went back to the boardroom for 11am, where Christian held a workshop on 
                              "Processing" which is a programming language similar to Java. He showed us how open display boxes and display shapes, and how to change their colours and
                              even how to toggle between colours using the If-Else conditional statements. 
                            <h3 class="has-text-centered">Noon</h3>
                            <p> We had a small break after that, then Lucia gave a presentation on RHIVOS 
                                (Red Hat In-Vehicle Operating System) which was very interesting. She told us about her workflow, and her place in her group.

                            After lunch, Christian held a very interesting Python workshop in the boardroom. We forked his code off of github for
                            bounce game. The issues he set out were to fix bugs in the code to make the game work properly again, then we had to update 
                            some of the features and personalise the game. I enjoyed this greatly as I manged to grasp python quite well.
